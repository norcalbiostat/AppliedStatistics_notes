# (PART) Multivariate Analysis {-}

# Introduction {#mv-intro}

There is an important distinction between _multivariable_ and _multivariate_ models. 

* _multivariable_ : Multiple predictor variables ($\mathbf{x}$). 
* _multivariate_: Multiple response variables ($\mathbf{Y}$). 

Often analysts will misuse  _multivariate_  when they really  mean _multivariable_. 

Multivariate techniques are

* Primarily used as an exploratory technique
* Restructure interrelated variables
* Simplify description
* Reduce dimensionality
* Avoid multicollinearity problems in regression

We will discuss two different, but related techniques: Principal Component Analysis and Factor Analysis.
