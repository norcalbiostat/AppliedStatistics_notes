# Principal Component Analysis {#pca}

More nomenclature tidbits: It's **"Principal"** Components (adjective), not **"Principle"** Components (noun)

From [Grammerist](http://grammarist.com/spelling/principle-principal/): 

> As a noun, principal refers to 
  (1) one who holds a presiding position or rank, and 
  (2) capital or property before interest, 
  and it's also an adjective meaning 
  (3) first or most important in rank 
> 
> Principle is only a noun. In its primary sense, it refers to a basic truth, law, assumption, or rule.

This third definition (3) is the context in which we will be using this term.

## When is Principal Components Analysis (PCA) used? 

* simplify the description of a set of interrelated variables. 
* transform a set of correlated variables, to a new set of uncorrelated variables
* dimension reduction: collapse many variables into a few number of variables while maintaining the same amount of variation present in the data. 
    - Statistical modeling is all about explaining variance in an outcome based on the variance in predictors. 
    - The new variables are called principal components, and they are ordered by the amount of variance they contain. 
    - So the first few principal components, may contain the same amount of variance (information) contained in a much larger set of original variables. 
* multivariable outlier detection
    - individual records that have high values on the principal components variables are candidates for outliers or blunders on multiple variables. 
* as a solution for multicollinearity
    - often is it useful to obtain the first few principal components corresponding to a set of highly correlated X variables, and then conduct regression analysis on the selected components. 
* as a step towards factor analysis (next section)
* as an exploratory technique that may be used in gaining a better understanding of the relationships between measures. 



**Not variable selection**

Principal Components Analysis (PCA) differs from variable selection in two ways:

1. No dependent variable exists
2. Variables are not eliminated but rather summary variables, i.e., principal components, are computed from all of the original variables. 

We are trying to understand a phenomenon by collecting a series of component measurements, but the underlying mechanics is complex and not easily understood by simply looking at each component individually. The data could be redundant and high levels of multicolinearity may be present. 



## Basic Idea - change of coordinates {#basic-idea}

Consider a hypothetical data set that consists of 100 random pairs of observations $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$ that are correlated. Let $X_{1} \sim \mathcal{N}(100, 100)$, $X_{2} \sim \mathcal{N}(50, 50)$, with $\rho_{12} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$. 

In matrix notation this is written as: $\mathbf{X} \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\mathbf{\mu}, \mathbf{\Sigma}\right)$ where 
$$\mathbf{\mu} = 
  \left(\begin{array}
  {r}
  \mu_{1} \\
  \mu_{2}
  \end{array}\right), 
  \mathbf{\Sigma} = 
  \left(\begin{array}
  {cc}
  \sigma_{1}^{2} & \rho_{12}\sigma_{x}\sigma_{y} \\
  \rho_{12}\sigma_{x}\sigma_{y} & \sigma_{2}^{2} 
  \end{array}\right)
$$. 

```{r}
set.seed(456)
m <- c(100, 50)
s <- matrix(c(100, sqrt(.5*100*50), sqrt(.5*100*50), 50), nrow=2)
data <- data.frame(MASS::mvrnorm(n=100, mu=m, Sigma=s))
colnames(data) <- c("X1", "X2")

plot(X2 ~ X1, data=data, pch=16)
```


Goal: Create two new variables $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ as linear combinations of $\mathbf{x_{1}}$ and $\mathbf{x_{2}}$ 

$$ \mathbf{C_{1}} = a_{11}\mathbf{x_{1}} + a_{12}\mathbf{x_{2}} $$
$$ \mathbf{C_{2}} = a_{21}\mathbf{x_{1}} + a_{22}\mathbf{x_{2}} $$

or more simply $\mathbf{C = aX}$, where

* The $\mathbf{x}$'s have been centered by subtracting their mean ($\mathbf{x_{1}} = x_{1}-\bar{x_{1}}$)
* $Var(C_{1})$ is as large as possible 

Graphically we're creating two new axes, where now $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ are uncorrelated. 

> PCA is mathematically defined as an orthogonal linear transformation that transforms the data to a new coordinate system such that the greatest variance by some projection of the data comes to lie on the first coordinate (called the first principal component), the second greatest variance on the second coordinate, and so on.  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis)


![](images/pca_coord_rotate.png)

In Linear Algebra terms, this is a [change of basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_of_basis). We are changing from a coordinate system of $(x_{1},x_{2})$ to $(c_{1}, c_{2})$. If you want to see more about this concept, here is a good [[YouTube Video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2LTAUO1TdA&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=13). 

## More Generally

We want

* From $P$ original variables $X_{1}, \ldots , X_{P}$ get $P$ principal components $C_{1}, \ldots , C_{P}$
* Where each $C_{j}$ is a linear combination of the $X_{i}$'s: $C_{j} = a_{j1}X_{1} + a_{j2}X_{2} + \ldots + a_{jP}X_{P}$
* The coefficients are chosen such that $Var(C_{1}) \geq Var(C_{2}) \geq \ldots \geq Var(C_{P})$
    - Variance is a measure of information. Consider modeling prostate cancer. 
        * Gender has 0 variance. No information.
        * Size of tumor: the variance is > 0, it provides useful information. 
* Any two PC's are uncorrelated: $Cov(C_{i}, C_{j})=0, \quad \forall i \neq j$

We have

$$
  \left[
    \begin{array}{r}
      C_{1} \\
      C_{2} \\
      \vdots \\
      C_{P}
    \end{array}
  \right] 
  = 
  \left[
    \begin{array}{cccc}
      a_{11} & a_{12} & \ldots & a_{1P} \\
      a_{21} & a_{22} & \ldots & a_{2P} \\
      \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
      a_{P1} & a_{P2} & \ldots & a_{PP} 
    \end{array}
  \right]
  \left[
    \begin{array}{r}
      X_{1} \\
      X_{2} \\
      \vdots \\
      X_{P}
  \end{array}
  \right] 
$$


* Hotelling (1933) showed that the columns of the matrix $a_{ij}$ are solutions to $(\mathbf{\Sigma} -\lambda\mathbf{I})\mathbf{a}=\mathbf{0}$. 
    - $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ is the variance-covariance matrix of the $\mathbf{X}$ variables.  
* This means $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue and $\mathbf{a}$ an eigenvector of the covariance matrix $\mathbf{\Sigma}$.
    - (Optional) Learn more about eigenvalues [[in this video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFDu9oVAE-g&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=14). 
* Problem: There are infinite number of possible $\mathbf{a}$'s
* Solution: Choose $a_{ij}$'s such that the sum of the squares of the coefficients for any one
  eigenvector is = 1. 
    - $P$ unique eigenvalues and $P$ corresponding eigenvectors. 

Which gives us 

* Variances of the $C_{j}$'s add up to the sum of the variances of the original variables (total variance).
* Can be thought of as variance decomposition into orthogonal (independet) vectors (variables). 
* With $Var(C_{1}) \geq Var(C_{2}) \geq \ldots \geq Var(C_{P})$. 

## R commands

```{block2, type='rmdnote'}

```


Calculating the principal components in R can be done using the function `prcomp()`, `princomp()` and functions from the `factoextra` package. This section of notes uses `princomp()` to generate the PCAs and helper functions from `factoextra` package.  [STHDA](http://www.sthda.com/english/articles/31-principal-component-methods-in-r-practical-guide/118-principal-component-analysis-in-r-prcomp-vs-princomp/) is a great reference for these functions.

### Generating PC's

The matrix that is used in `princomp` must be fully numeric.
```{r}
pr <- princomp(data)
```

### Viewing the amount of variance contained by each PC

Use `summary` or `get_eigenvalue` to see the variance breakdown. 

```{r}
summary(pr)
factoextra::get_eigenvalue(pr)
```

The first PC (`Comp.1`) will always explain the highest proportion of variance (by mathematical design).

### Vizualize Loadings

#### As a matrix of values

* The values for the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is contained in `pr$loadings`. Alternatively the `loadings` function will extract this matrix. 
```{r}
pr$loadings
loadings(pr)
```

$$
C_{1} = 0.854x_1 + 0.519X_2 \\
C_{2} =  0.519x_1 - 0.854X_2
$$

#### As a vector plot

To visualize how these two new PC's create new axes these new axes, we plot the centered data. 
```{r, fig.align='center', fig.height=4, fig.width=4}
a <- pr$loadings
x1 <- with(data, X1 - mean(X1))
x2 <- with(data, X2 - mean(X2))

plot(c(-40, 40), c(-20, 20), type="n",xlab="x1", ylab="x2")
points(x=x1, y=x2, pch=16)
abline(0, a[2,1]/a[1,1]); text(30, 10, expression(C[1]))
abline(0, a[2,2]/a[1,2]); text(-10, 20, expression(C[2]))
```

Another useful plot is called a **biplot**. Here the PC's are on the dominant axes, and the red vectors show you the magnitude and direction of the original variables on this new axis. 

```{r}
biplot(pr)
library(factoextra)
fviz_pca_biplot(pr)
```

* X1 is positively correlated with both PC1 and PC2
* X2 is positively correlated with PC1 but negatively correlated with PC2. 

This information was also seen in the loading values. 

#### As a heatmap

* Often in high dimensional studies, the loadings are visualized using a heatmap. 
* Here we use the `heatmap.2()` in the `gplots` package. I encourage you to play with the options such as `dendogram` and `trace` to see what they remove/add, and review the `?heatmap.2` help file.
    
```{r}
library(gplots)
heatmap.2(pr$loadings, dendrogram="none", trace="none", density.info="none")
```

#### As a strength of reprensetation 

Contribution of rows/columns to the PC's. For a given dimension, any row/column with a contribution above the reference line could be considered as important in contributing to the dimension.

```{r}
fviz_contrib(pr, choice = "var", axes = 1)
```

X1 contributes more than half of the amount of information to PC1 compared to X2



#### As a correlation circle

With only 2 PC's this isn't that informative. The later example and the vignette are likely more helpful. 

See [STDHA correlation circle](http://www.sthda.com/english/articles/31-principal-component-methods-in-r-practical-guide/112-pca-principal-component-analysis-essentials#graph-of-variables) for detailed information. 

```{r}
fviz_pca_var(pr, col.var = "contrib", axes=c(1,2),
             gradient.cols = c("#00AFBB", "#E7B800", "#FC4E07"), 
             repel = TRUE # Avoid text overlapping
             )
```


## Data Reduction

```{block2, type='rmdnote'}
Corresponding reading: PMA6 Ch 14.5
```

* Keep first $m$ principal components as representatives of original P variables
* Keep enough to explain a large percentage of original total variance.
* Ideally you want a small number of PC's that explain a large percentage of the total variance. 

### Choosing $m$

* Rely on existing theory 
* Explain a given % of variance (cumulative percentage plot)
* All eigenvalues > 1 (Scree plot)
* Elbow rule (Scree Plot)

A _Scree plot_ is created by plotting the eigenvalue against the PC number. 

```{r}
fviz_eig(pr, addlabels = TRUE)
```

These are best understood using an example containing more than two PC's, but there is one more thing to consider first and that is how the data is prepared before calculating the principal components. 


## Standardizing

Often researchers will standardize the $x$ variables before conducting a PCA. 

* Standardizing: Take $X$ and divide each element by $\sigma_{x}$. 

  $$\frac{X}{\sigma_{X}}$$

* Normalizing: Centering and standardizing. 
  
  $$Z = \frac{(X-\bar{X})}{\sigma_{X}}$$
    
* Equivalent to analyzing the correlation matrix ($\mathbf{R}$) instead of covariance matrix ($\mathbf{\Sigma}$).


```{block2, type='rmdwarning'}
Using correlation matrix vs covariance matrix will generate different PC's
```

This makes sense given the difference in matricies: 

```{r}
cov(data) #Covariance Matrix
cor(data) #Correlation Matrix
```

Standardizing your data prior to analysis (using $\mathbf{R}$ instead of $\mathbf{\Sigma}$) aids the interpretation of the PC's in a few ways

1. The total variance is the number of variables $P$
2. The proportion explained by each PC is the corresponding eigenvalue / $P$
3. The correlation between $C_{i}$ and standardized variable $x_{j}$ can be written as $r_{ij} = a_{ij}SD(C_{i})$

This last point means that for any given $C_{i}$ we can quantify the relative degree of dependence of the PC on each of the standardized variables. This is a.k.a. the **factor loading** (we will return to this key term later).

To calculate the principal components using the correlation matrix using `princomp`, set the `cor` argument to `TRUE`. 

```{r}
pr_corr <- princomp(data, cor=TRUE)
summary(pr_corr)
pr_corr$loadings
```

* If we use the covariance matrix and change the scale of a variable (i.e. in to cm) that will change the results of the PC's
* Many researchers prefer to use the correlation matrix
    - It compensates for the units of measurements for the different variables. 
    - Interpretations are made in terms of the standardized variables. 

$$
C_{1} = 0.707x_1 + 0.707X_2 \\
C_{2} = 0.707x_1 - 0.707X_2
$$

I want to compare them side by side in a nice table. 

```{r}
data.frame(PC1.cov = loadings(pr)[,1],
           PC2.cov = loadings(pr)[,2],
           PC1.cor = loadings(pr_corr)[,1],
           PC2.cor = loadings(pr_corr)[,2]) |> kable(digits=2)
```

## Example

This example follows _Analysis of depression data set_ section in PMA6 Section 14.5. This survey asks 20 questions on emotional states that relate to depression. The data is recorded as numeric, but are categorical in nature where 0 - "rarely or none of the time", 1 - "some or a little of the time" and so forth. 

```{r}
depress <- read.delim("https://norcalbiostat.netlify.com/data/depress_081217.txt", header=TRUE)
table(depress$c1)
```

These questions are typical of what is asked in survey research, and often are thought of, or treated as _pseudo-continuous_. They are ordinal categorical variables, but they are not truly interval measures since the "distance" between 0 and 1 (rarely and some of the time), would not be considered the same as the distance between 2 (moderately) and 3 (most or all of the time). And "moderately" wouldn't be necessarily considered as "twice" the amount of "rarely". 

Our options to use these ordinal variables in a model come down to three options. 

* convert to a factor and include it as a categorical (series of indicators) variable. 
    - This can be even more problematic when there are 20 categorical variables. You run out of degrees of freedom very fast with that many predictors. 
* leave it as numeric and treat it as pseudo-continuous ordinal measure. Where you can interpret as "as x increases y changes by...", but 
* aggregate across multiple likert-type-ordinal variables and create a new calculated scale variable that can be treated as continuous.
    - This is what PCA does by creating new variables $C_{1}$ that are linear combinations of the original $x's$. 

In this example I use PCA to reduce these 20 correlated variables down to a few uncorrelated variables that explain the most variance. 

**1. Read in the data and run `princomp` on the `C1:C20` variables.**
```{r}
pc_dep  <- princomp(depress[,9:28], cor=TRUE)
summary(pc_dep)
```

**2. Pick a subset of PC's to work with**

In the cumulative percentage plot below, I drew a reference line at 80%. So the first 10 PC's can explain around 80% of the variance in the data. 

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=4, fig.align='center'}

(create.cumvar.plot <- get_eigenvalue(pc_dep) %>%
  mutate(PC = paste0("PC", 1:20), # create a new variable containing the PC name
         PC = forcats::fct_reorder(PC, cumulative.variance.percent))  # reorder this by the value of the cumulative variance
 ) 

ggplot(create.cumvar.plot, 
       aes(y = PC, 
           x = cumulative.variance.percent)) + 
  geom_point(size=4) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 80)
```

**3. Create a _Scree plot_ by plotting the eigenvalue or the proportion of variance from that eigenvalue against the PC number.**

```{r}
gridExtra::grid.arrange(
  fviz_eig(pc_dep, choice = "eigenvalue", addlabels = TRUE),
  fviz_screeplot(pc_dep, addlabels = TRUE)
)
```

* **Option 1**: Take all eigenvalues > 1 ($m=5$)  
* **Option 2**: Use a cutoff point where the lines joining consecutive points are steep to the left of the cutoff point and flat right of the cutoff point. Point where the two slopes meet is the elbow. ($m=2$). 

**4. Examine the loadings**

```{r}
pc_dep$loadings[1:3,1:5]
```

Here

* $X_{1}$ = _"I felt that I could not shake..."_
* $X_{2}$ = _"I felt depressed..."_

So the PC's are calculated as

$$
C_{1} = 0.277x_{1} + 0.313x_{2} + \ldots \\
C_{2} = -0.1449x_{1} + 0.0271x_{2} + \ldots
$$

etc...

```{block2 , type='rmdnote'}
The full question text for the depression data used here can be found on Table 14.2 in the PMA6 textbook.
```

**5. Interpret the PC's**

* Visualize the loadings using `heatmap.2()` in the `gplots` package. 
    - I reversed the colors so that red was high positive correlation and yellow/white is low. 
    - half the options I use below come from [this SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11713563/heatmap-color-key-with-five-different-colors). I had no idea what they did, so I took what the solution showed, and played with it (added/changed some to see what they did), and reviewed `?heatmap.2` to see what options were available. 
    
```{r}
heatmap.2(pc_dep$loadings[,1:5], scale="none", Rowv=NA, Colv=NA, density.info="none",
          dendrogram="none", trace="none", col=rev(heat.colors(256)))
```

* Loadings over 0.5 (red) help us interpret what these components could "mean"
    - Must know exact wording of component questions
    
* $C_{1}$: a weighted average of most items. High value indicates the respondent had many symptoms of depression. Note sign of loadings are all positive and all roughly the same color. 
    - Recall 
* $C_{2}$: lethargy (high energetic). High loading on c14, 16, 17, low on 4, 8, 20
* $C_{3}$: friendliness of others. Large negative loading on c19, c9

etc. 

**Contributions***
```{r}
fviz_contrib(pc_dep, choice = "var", axes = 1, top=10)
fviz_contrib(pc_dep, choice = "var", axes = 2, top=10)
```


```{r}
fviz_pca_var(pc_dep, col.var = "contrib", axes=c(1,2),
             gradient.cols = c("#00AFBB", "#E7B800", "#FC4E07"), 
             repel = TRUE # Avoid text overlapping
             )

fviz_pca_var(pc_dep, col.var = "contrib", axes=c(3,4),
             gradient.cols = c("#00AFBB", "#E7B800", "#FC4E07"), 
             repel = TRUE # Avoid text overlapping
             )
```




## Use in Multiple Regression
* Choose a handful of few principal components to use as predictors in a regression model 
    - Leads to more stable regression estimates.
* Alternative to variable selection
    - Ex: several measures of behavior. 
    - Use PC$_{1}$ or PC$_{1}$ and PC$_{2}$ as summary measures of all.

### Example: Modeling acute illness

The 20 depression questions `C1:C20` were designed to be added together to create the CESD scale directly. While this is a validate measure, what if some components (e.g. had crying spells) contributes more to someones level of depression than another measure (e.g. people were unfriendly). Since the PC's are linear combinations of the $x$'s, the coefficients $a$, or the loadings, aren't all equal as we've seen. So let's see if the first two PC's (since that's what was chosen from the scree plot) can predict chronic illness better than the straight summative score of `cesd`. 

**1. Extract PC scores and attach them to the data. **

The scores for each PC for each observation is stored in the `scores` list object in the `pc_dep` object. 

```{r}
dim(pc_dep$scores); kable(pc_dep$scores[1:5, 1:5])
depress$pc1 <- pc_dep$scores[,1]
depress$pc2 <- pc_dep$scores[,2]
```

**2. Fit a model using those PC scores as covariates** 

Along with any other covariates chosen by other methods. 

```{r}
glm(acuteill~pc1+pc2, data=depress, family='binomial') %>% summary()
glm(acuteill~cesd, data=depress, family='binomial') %>% summary()
```


In this example, the model using the PC's and the model using `cesd` were very similar. However, this is an example where an aggregate measure such as `cesd` has already been figured out scientifically and validated. This is not often the case, expecially in exploratory data analysis when you are not sure -how- the measures are correlated. 



## Things to watch out for
* Eigenvalues are estimated variances of the PC's and so are subject to large sample variations. 
* The size of variance of last few principal components can be useful as indicator of multicollinearity among original variables
* Principal components derived from standardized variables differ from those derived from original variables
* Important that measurements are accurate, especially for detection of collinearity

```{block2, type='rmdcaution'}
Arbitrary cutoff points should not be taken too seriously.
```
