See Figure 4.18b in PMA6 as an example. We can do better than looking at profile plots and trying to see which observations behave “similarly”. Let’s leverage some math concepts and introduce measures of “distance” between two observations. For cluster analysis, we need to use the wide data set, where each variable is it’s own column, and only the numeric variables containing the measurements. Not the row information such as symbol. Here I set the row names of this numeric matrix to the symbols.

["distance-measures.html", "14.3 Distance Measures", " 14.3 Distance Measures Let’s start with 2 dimensions, and the most familiar type of distance: Euclidean distance. Credit: Wikipedia Recalling the Pythagorean formula, the Euclidean distance between two points \\((p_{1}, p_{2})\\) and \\((q_{1}, q_{2})\\) is \\[ d_{euc} = \\sqrt{(q_{1} - p_{1})^{2} + (q_{2} - p_{2})^{2} }\\] This formula is generalizable to \\(p\\) dimensions, so we can calculate the distance between observations on \\(p\\) numeric variables. The details of calculating a multivariate Euclidean distance is left to a third semester of calculus, but the concept is the same. This measure is commonly referred to as the Euclidean norm, or L2 norm. Distance measures are not invariant to changes in scale (units of measurement). Distances between measures that are in the thousands, are much larger than distances between measures that are in the micrograms. This is why you always need to scale the data prior to analysis. 14.3.1 Other measures of distance Euclidean distance tends to be the default in most algorithms. Manhattan distance is similar, calculated using the sum of the absolute value distances: \\[ d_{man} = |(q_{1} - p_{1})| + |(q_{2} - p_{2})| \\] Correlation-based distances. Pearson, Spearman, Kendall to name a few. Widely used for gene expression data distance is defined by subtracting the correlation coefficient from 1. When discussing the closeness of records, we are meaning the minimum distance on all \\(p\\) dimensions under consideration. For this class we will default to using the Euclidean distance unless otherwise specified. 14.3.2 Gowers’s dissimilarity measure as a distance measures for binary data When your data is only 0/1, the concept of distance between records (vectors) is not quite the same. In this case you are going to need to use a different type of distance, or dissimilarity measure called the Gower distance. This is created as follows, and used in the same way any other distance matrix is used. gower.d &lt;- daisy(x = cluster.dta, metric = &quot;gower&quot;) This information has not been read through in great detail, but reading thorough the following document, the information looks credible and there is a reference to an original paper.

The diagonal is black, because each record has 0 distance from itself. You can change these colors. fviz_dist(d, order=TRUE, show_labels=TRUE, gradient=list(low=&quot;black&quot;, mid=&quot;blue&quot;, high=&quot;white&quot;)) order=TRUE sorts the distances, so notice hum is furthest away from almost all other companies except nme. win and lks seem to be a bit ‘further’ away from others. We will explore two methods of clustering: hierarchical and non-hierarchical "],
["hierarchical-clustering.html", "14.4 Hierarchical clustering", " 14.4 Hierarchical clustering We can visualize clusters calculated using hierarchical methods using dendograms. These are awesome tree-based visualizations, similar to visualizations created for decision trees and random forest models (leafs, nodes, stems, roots). PMA6 Figure 16.7 There are two main approaches to linking records into clusters: Agglomerative is a bottom-up approach. This begins with \\(N\\) clusters (each observation is a cluster), and at each step two observations that are the most similar are combined until all observations are in a single cluster. Good at identifying small clusters. AKA AGNES (agglomerative nesting) Devisive is a top-down approach. This begins with one cluster containing all the observations, and splits off cases that are most dissimilar to the rest until each observation is in it’s own cluster. Good at identifying large clusters. Not that common, so will not be discussed further. AKA DIANA (divise analysis). 14.4.1 Linkages At each step in agglomerative clustering, the clusters with the smallest linkage distance between the two clusters are combined. This linkage distance can be computed using several linkage methods. Centroid linkage (PMA6 Fig 16.5). The closest two records are combined, and their centroid is calculated. The centroid is calculated as the mean of the length \\(p\\)-vector, for our 2 dimensional example in the last section this would be \\((\\bar{p}, \\bar{q})\\). This centroid point/vector takes the place of the original records in the data set. Then the next closest set of points are combined, and their centroid calculated. The centroid need not be an actual measured observation in the data set. Single Linkage Each step clusters are combined that contain the closest pair of points, not yet in the same cluster as each other. Complete Linkage Calculate all pairwise distances between points in each cluster. The distance between clusters is the maximum value of the pairwise differences. I.e. the pair of points in each cluster that are the furthest away from each other. At each step, the two clusters that are separated by the shortest maximum distance are combined. Ward’s D Minimizes the within-cluster variance. Within cluster variance is calculated as the weighted squared distance between clusters. For the initial step, this is the squared euclidean distance between all points. At each step the pair of clusters that lead to the smallest increase in the total within-cluster variance are merged. 14.4.2 Comparing Linkage methods par(mfrow=c(2,2)) hclust(d, method=&quot;centroid&quot;) %&gt;% plot(main=&quot;Centroid Linkage&quot;) hclust(d, method=&quot;single&quot;) %&gt;% plot(main=&quot;Single Linkage&quot;) hclust(d, method=&quot;complete&quot;) %&gt;% plot(main=&quot;Complete Linkage&quot;) hclust(d, method=&quot;ward.D&quot;) %&gt;% plot(main=&quot;Ward&#39;s Method&quot;) In these plots, “height” is a measure of similarity/distance. Also, the longer the “stem” the greater the distance. Things I picked out from these plots. hum is the last company to be added to any cluster using any methods. rei also seems to stand alone as being different from the others. Ward’s method seems to create more distinct clusters compared to the other methods common companies that are grouped in all methods: nme, hca, ami uk, ald, roh sf, dia, dow gra, hpc, acy, and sometimes mtc. 14.4.3 Dendogram extras If we say there are 4 clusters, we can use fviz_dend to color the dendogram by those clusters. clust.ward &lt;- hclust(d, method=&quot;ward.D&quot;) a &lt;- fviz_dend(clust.ward, rect=TRUE, k=4) b &lt;- fviz_dend(clust.ward, k =4, rect = TRUE, color_labels_by_k = TRUE, rect_border = c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;purple&quot;), rect_fill = TRUE, lower_rect = -1) grid.arrange(a, b, ncol=2) Other options fviz_dend(clust.ward, k = 4, k_colors = &quot;RdBu&quot;, type = &quot;phylogenic&quot;, relep = TRUE , phylo_layout = &quot;layout_as_tree&quot;) fviz_dend(clust.ward, cex = 0.6, k = 4, type = &quot;circular&quot;, rect = TRUE) "],

When you have lots of records, it can be impossible to identify individual records. But do you need to? One of the goals is to identify if there are clusters of individuals. Then if there are, you may (or may not) be interested in identifying what makes the clusters similar. If you’re really interested in the characteristics in individuals being close to each other you can use existing plotting techniques that we’ve used for bivarate plots, and for PCA. Cluster analysis is an exploratory technique. We can use some existing summary tools to explore what the groups, or clusters, are like. 14.8.1 Univariate distribution of clusters What’s the distribution of clusters?

Hierarchical clustering does not have this restriction. The agglomerative coefficient increases with the number of rows. You can NOT use it to compare between two datasets that are very different in size. Cluster analysis methods are sensitive to outliers Different results can occur if you change the order of the data. The centroid does not have to be part of the data set. Alternative methods such as k-medians or k-medoids restrict the centroids to be an actual record that is ‘closest’ to the calculated mean. Number of clusters depends on the desired level of similarity. Since different algorithms can produce different results, this is especially true across software programs.
